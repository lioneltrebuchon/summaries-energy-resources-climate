In July and August 2025, the Northern Hemisphere experienced many wildfires, after an already prolific 2024 season.
Damage to nature was considerable at "", while damage to property remained comparatively small, due to fires mostly staying clear of human settlement.
This season might have marked the first time so many fires were simultaneously attributible to climate change.

# Disclaimer
Wildfires are a natural part of the Canadian boreal forest life cycle as well as other forest, grassland and bushland life cycles.
Today, we discuss how we're currently witnessing climate change modify our biotope and expectations w.r.t wildfires. Remember: climate change includes global warming, yes, but for the current discussion, what's more relevant is that it shifts local equilibrium points. Our lands, forests, and underwater worlds will change.

# Attribution science
The science of identifying the main driver of a natural event is called **attribution science**. It’s a mix of forecasting (incl. trending, detrending), physical modeling (climate, weather), and probabilistic, stochastic and statistical modeling (on top of everything).
Attribution science can be frustrating to scientists and even more so to science communicators, because it deals with likelihoods and probabilities and does not allow clear-cut simplifications.
This is particularly the case for wildfires, where the origin is mostly human (arson or involuntarily account for ~90% of ignitions worldwide, particularly in Europe) and lightning strike (more surface area burnt by lightning strike fires, which also occur in remote regions ~80% of Canadian wildfires are caused by lightning).

On 10th of August 2025, we have expectional news:
**The Northern hemisphere wildfires in 2025 were made possible by climate change. They would not have been possible without, in the climate which humans experienced since their apparition on Earth.**

# Context
Recent heavily publicized fires were most likely "supercharged" by climate change, but the attribution science wasn't clear-cut.

Examples include:
- **Australian summer 2019/2020**: created significant damage to nature. Up to **19 million hectares were burnt**, with 12.6 million hectares primarily forest and bushland. 33 lives were lost and around 3,094 homes destroyed. [WWF](https://wwf.org.au/what-we-do/australian-bushfires/)
- **Canadian 2023 wildfire season**: records shattered with over 18.5 million hectares burned — **more than double the previous record** of 7.1 million hectares from 1995 [Last 2023 National fire situation report](https://ciffc.net/situation/2023-10-06) [Canadian Geographic](https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/mapping-100-years-of-forest-fires-in-canada)
- **Brazil 2024 Pantanal, Amazon, Cerrado wildfires**: consumed up to 46 million hectares (combining forest and grassland) and the first time on record that more forest than grassland burnt in the Amazonas [phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2025-01-brazil-area.html)
- **LA fire January 2025**: significant in terms of property destroyed (~12.5 thousand hectares burnt, **destroying more than 16,000 structures**, total insured market loss to be approximately **USD 40 billion** [Swiss Re](https://www.swissre.com/reinsurance/insights/california-wildfires-european-insurers.html))
- **South Korea March 2025**: largest ever wildfires, climate change doubled the likelihood of favorable weather conditions [worldweatherattribution.org](https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-made-weather-conditions-leading-to-deadly-south-korean-wildfires-about-twice-as-likely/)

# 2025 cases

In full transparency, the attribution hasn't been published yet. But we can make an educated guess

## Greece and Turkey fires 

## France Aude region
France has started precisely monitoring wildfires since Napoleon. Importantly, wildfires were relevant in early-industrialization France: ships were still made of wood, wood was the main source of heat, and there was danger of bushfires ruining harvests, in a world where agriculture was still significantly above 50% of the economy.
Now, in this history of France, the speed of the Aude wildfire is unprecedented. This is not only due to wind, but notably to the dry wet cycles we now experienced, which is attributed to climate change alreadz. 
In other words, an Aude fire equivalent has not been experienced in 225 years of recorded French wildfire history. Note that back in the times of Napoléon, there were no Canadian-built fire-fighting planes in France.
Note  Marine Lanet, Laurent Li and Hervé le Treut published a paper beginning of 2025 where their state of the art model resulted in at least x5 times likelihood of wildfire prone events during the month of August (low-emission scenario) [Substantial increase in wildfire danger conditions under anthropogenic climate change in Southwest France](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44304-025-00124-0.pdf).
