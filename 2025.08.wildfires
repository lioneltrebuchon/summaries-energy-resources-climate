In July and August 2025, the Northern Hemisphere experienced many wildfires, after an already prolific 2024 season.
Damage to nature was considerable at "", while damage to property remained comparatively small, due to fires mostly staying clear of human settlement.
This season might have marked the first time so many fires were simultaneously attributible to climate change.

# Context
Previous heavily publicized fires were most likely "supercharged" by climate change, but the attribution science wasn't clear-cut. Examples include:
- Australia 2019/2020 ([Up to 19 million hectares were burnt, with 12.6 million hectares primarily forest and bushland. 33 lives were lost and around 3,094 homes destroyed.](https://wwf.org.au/what-we-do/australian-bushfires/) )
- and the LA fire
